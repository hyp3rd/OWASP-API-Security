## Active Scan and Passive Scan

Active Scan actively sends requests to the web application, attempting to discover vulnerabilities, while Passive Scan analyzes web application traffic without actively sending requests. Both scanning methods are essential for identifying different types of security vulnerabilities.

## Authentication and Session Management

ZAP supports various authentication methods and session management techniques, allowing you to test web applications with different types of access control and user management.

- [ZAP Session Management](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/desktop/start/features/sessionmanagement/)

## Manipulator-in-the-middle Proxy and Breakpoints

ZAP's manipulator-in-the-middle proxy allows you to intercept, analyze, and modify HTTP/S traffic. Breakpoints enable you to pause the request/response processing at specific points, allowing for greater control and analysis of web application traffic.
